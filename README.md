## Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing current and prospective customers into meaningful sub-groups based on shared metrics and traits. Businesses can refine targeted marketing measures and strategies to smaller, specific groups supported by a deep understanding of consumer preferences and needs. 

In dividing markets, researchers search for common characteristics such as demographics, geographical location, and behavior trends. The segments an organization uses vary depending on its size and industry. 

#### **Demographics:**
Demographic segmentation involves dividing consumers based on factors such as age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income and education level. For example, if a product is popular among students, demographic segmentation can be used to create distinct marketing messages that differ from those meant to appeal to parents.
#### **Geographics:**
Geographic segmentation includes grouping customers by region, including what county, state, city and town the person lives in. This approach can offer insight into preferred language, cultural practices, and local climate. For instance, an automobile manufacturer might focus on snow tires and All Wheel Drive systems in snowy locations, while seat ventilation and air conditioning may be featured in hotter climates. 
#### **Behavior:**
Behavioral segmentation is based on customer behaviors and interactions with a brand. This considers spending and media habits, hobbies, product use and desired benefits. This could include purchase history, loyalty and rewards programs, and customer website and social media interactions. 
#### **Needs-Based:**
Needs-based segmentation focuses on common consumer needs. This may include requirements for a product or service, delivery methods, or how personal dersires are met. Needs-based segmentations offers more useful products, builds trust with customers, and develops markets for new products and technologies.


#### **Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C)**

Though both processess involve taking the needs, behaviors, and characteristics of specific customer groups into consideration, the customer segmentation process may work differently when marketing and selling to consumers, as opposed to other businesses.

- For behavioral segmentation, B2C marketing might consider consumer browsing history, spending habits, and brand interaction. A B2B marketer might study how business contacts interact with one another througout various organizations and across emails.
  
-  B2C marketers might segment customers based on demographic details like income, family or relationship status, and age group. B2B marketers might segment customers based on industry, company size, revenue, and the roles and teams within.
  
## Objective 

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5). After intensive market research, they’ve deduced that the behavior of new market is similar to their existing market. 

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy on new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers. 

This project aims to helps to predict the right group of the new customers.
