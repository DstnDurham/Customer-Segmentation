## Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing current and prospective customers into meaningful sub-groups based on shared metrics and traits. Businesses can refine targeted marketing measures and strategies to smaller, specific groups supported by a deep understanding of consumer preferences and needs. 

In dividing markets, researchers search for common characteristics such as demographics, geographical location, and behavior trends. The segments an organization uses vary depending on its size and industry.
